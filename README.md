cauca is a WIP Gameboy emulator written in go, mainly to learn the language. The main resource used for this project is a Gameboy manual that can be found [here](http://marc.rawer.de/Gameboy/Docs/GBCPUman.pdf). A particularly usefull resource is the Gameboy debugger [WasmBoy](https://wasmboy.app/).
